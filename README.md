# Cybel-translations
The translation files for the music bot Cybel.

## Contributing
Clone this repository, create a new branch, make your changes (I.E. adding a new translation file or altering someone else's), then make a pull request. All changes to the main file (EN.json) will need to be repeated throughout the other translation files. All changes to this file will be announced on the Discord server.

## File naming
To name your file, find a website that lists the country locale codes (https://saimana.com/list-of-country-locale-code/ for example), and then name the file as such. Make sure the file name is all caps.
